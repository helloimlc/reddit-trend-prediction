# Reddit Trend Prediction

Predictive modelling system for classifying whether a Reddit post is likely to become popular using machine learning.

This project was developed as my Final Year Project for the University of London BSc Computer Science programme.

---

## Project Overview

Reddit generates millions of posts across thousands of communities every day. While some posts receive significant attention, many receive little engagement.

This project investigates whether the popularity of a Reddit post can be predicted before publication using machine learning models trained on textual, metadata, and temporal features.

The project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web application.

## Streamlit Application

The trained model was deployed using Streamlit to allow users to predict Reddit post popularity interactively.

The application allows users to:

- Enter Reddit post information
- Select subreddit
- Choose posting time
- Predict popularity
- View prediction confidence



---

## Dataset

This project uses Reddit data collected from Kaggle.

The dataset is not included in this repository because of its size.
